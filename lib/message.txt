Love, Love, Love!
Love, Love, Love!
Love, Love, Love?

There's nothing-you can do that can't be done
Nothing-you can sing that can't be sung
Nothing-you can say, but you can learn how to play the game it's easy
Nothing you can make that can't be made No one you can save that can't be saved
Nothing you can do, but you can learn how to be you in time It's easy

All you need is love, all you need is love
All you need is love, love, love is all you need
All you need is love All you need is love, love, love is all you need
