Bryan
1. Definitely need to get more comforatable with the capabilities of Ruby.  I feel that I know what I want to happen, but can get
lost in the process of how to do it in Ruby.  I also find my inner learner and take joy in learning not feel dread at deadlines and
fears of failure.

Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):
We are still leaving this open as it will depend on the development what we each feel most comfortable on

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests):
We are each working on branches of Git and will merge the other persons branches
