Ok so if we bring in the file as 2 by 3 array. We then have the keys in the format
that we would want to print then out in

Then if you create a count variable and iterate over three times
count = 0
3times.
letter.map do |letter|
Hash[letter][count]  (maybe we could shovel these into array then we would have three 160 arrays that would be our lines) or we could create hashes line 1 to linex and then print the hashes out in order going to need to join the array in and out of the loop.atom
count +=1


if letter was an array of the text would this translate the numbers that we could write to
a file


in order for this to work we would need to bring the text in one line at a time and
translate and output this one line at a time to the textfile.  

Is there any way to bring it all in at once.  If we can smash it all together we could


Getting data in order

Bring in text file search and replace capital letters with % and the letter. Search and repace numbers with # and letter a - i.
