# night_writer
The Night Writer project is a project to make a program in Ruby that will translate English text files into a computer
equivalent of Braille. It will be a series of 0 and . that represent dots and blanks of Braille text. We are taking in a text
file and the output will be a Braille file of the same text. The capped line length of each line of Braille will be 160 characters
 long.  We will also include code to take a Braille file and return it to a text file.
