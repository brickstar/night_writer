"Love, Love, Love!\n
Love, Love, Love?\n
Love, Love, Love\n
There's nothing-you can do that can't be done.\n
Nothing-you can sing that can't be sung\n
Nothing-you can say, but you can learn how to play the game it's easy.
Nothing you can make that can't be made No one you can save that can't be saved
Nothing you can do, but you can learn how to be you in time It's easy All you need is love, all you need is love All you need is love, love, love is all you needAll you need is love All you need is love, love, love is all you need"
