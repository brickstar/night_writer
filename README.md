# night_writer
Night Writer is a project to make a program in Ruby that will translate English text files into a computer
equivalent of Braille. It will be a series of 0 and . that represent dots and blanks of Braille text. The program will read in an English text file and write the Braille translation to a separate file. It will also convert the Braille text file back to English. The Braille file has a constraint of 80 characters in width.
